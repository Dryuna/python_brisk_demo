Quick Usage
===========
    python brisk_demo.py


Introduction
============
As an inexperienced opencv user, getting the feature detection working in python
took some time. Then I realized that SIFT / SURF / everything that has some
scale invariance in OpenCV was encumbered with patents. With BRISK, now there is
a viable (sometimes better!) alternative.

I hope this example helps anyone else who wants to get started in python with
feature detection.
